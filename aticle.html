<h1>Deputies Arrest Suspect after Victim Slashed near Antioch</h1>

<h2>Suspect Arrested for Serious Assault</h2>

<p>Authorities say a suspect has been taken into custody after he slashed a victim in the face with a knife, leaving him with very serious injuries, near Antioch Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>The Lake County Sheriff’s Office responded around 12:25 a.m. Wednesday to the 21200 block of Route 173 in unincorporated Antioch for a report of a domestic battery in progress.</p>

<p>Sheriff’s 911 dispatchers were able to gather information that a knife was being used in the attack and they alerted responding deputies of the information, according to Lake County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Chief Christopher Covelli.</p>

<blockquote>Sheriff’s deputies arrived and were able to de-escalate the situation, Covelli said.</blockquote>

<p>Deputies learned a 45-year-old man, who lives at the home, had been slashed across the face with a knife.</p>

<p>"The victim suffered significant facial injuries," Covelli stated.</p>

<p>A preliminary investigation shows the victim and his family member, Aaron Locklear, 54, who also lives in the home, got into a verbal argument.</p>

<p>The verbal argument became increasingly heated and Locklear produced a knife with an approximate eight-inch blade, Covelli said.</p>

<p><em>"Locklear slashed the victim across the right side of his face, causing a very serious laceration from near his eye extending to his lip," Covelli added.</em></p>

<p>Alcohol appeared to be a factor contributing to the incident.</p>

<p>Locklear was arrested and transported to an area hospital for treatment of a cut to his finger suffered during the battery.</p>

<p><strong>He was treated and released back into the custody of sheriff’s deputies.</strong></p>

<p>Locklear was transported to the Lake County Jail and charged with aggravated domestic battery, aggravated battery causing bodily harm, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.</p>

<p>Locklear appeared in First Appearance Court Wednesday morning where Lake County Judge Raymond Collins ordered him held pending a detention hearing, which was scheduled for Thursday afternoon.</p>
